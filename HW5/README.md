# Parallel Programming HW5: Image histogram statistics with OpenCL

## Build and run
* Put the build.sh and test.sh under your `/home/net` folder

* Use run.sh to run the program, show the execution time, and validate the correctness
(if your program is right, it shows /home/net/input-*M is correct)
```sh
./run.sh $Your_NCTU_Student_ID
```

* If you want to check the bottleneck of your OpenCL program, use the profiler script
```sh
./profiler.sh $Your_NCTU_Student_ID
```
