## Introduction
* The Gaussian Normal Distribution
$v \sim \mathcal{N} (m,\sigma^2)\ where\ N\ is\ the\ Gaussin\ Distribution\ with\ mean\ m\ and\ standard\ dev\ \sigma^2$

* Now porting to 2D

* Before and after
* Normal without Gaussian Filter applied

## Motivation

* Try to optimize the performance of `Gaussian Blur` on diffrernt platform including `OpenMP, CUDA, OpenCL`, and compare with the standard pthread and serial version which taught in the OS course.

## Experiment Workflow
* First, porting the Gaussian Blur Algorithm on different parallelization architecture taught in this course
* Run the algorithm on different parallelization architecture, compare the platform-time based on different filter scale ,stddev, and image size.
    * May use shell sccipt, python script to assist timing
    * Maybe the memory consumption can be checked as well
* bmpReader.cpp and rmpReader.h are used to read / write bmp image files since the bmp encoding group R G B together in 1-d array with R = arr[i] G = arr[i + 1] and b = arr[i + 2], we can use the array for image processing just like the normal C-style array manipulation with R G B just like color code #00FFBB each of them range from 0x0 to 0xFF
* create_matrix.cpp are used to create gaussian filter based on Gaussian Distribution
* mask_Gaussian.txt is where the Gaussian Matrix is stored(file generated by create_matrix.cpp)
* gaussian_blur_standard.cpp is the standard, non-parallized(serial) Gaussian Blur Algorithm
* Makefile are used to compile the project, which will be added more lines for compiling code of different parallization platforms 
* run.sh is the benchmark shellscript
